Below are features:
=================

Asynchronous and Event Driven:
  All APIs of Node.js library are aynchronous that is non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits 
  for a API to return data. Server moves to next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps 
  server to get response from the previous API call.

Very Fast:

  Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

Single Threaded but highly Scalable:
  Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps server to respond in a non-bloking ways and 
  makes server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses 
  a single threaded program and same program can services much larger number of requests than traditional server like Apache HTTP
  Server.

No Buffering - 
  Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.
